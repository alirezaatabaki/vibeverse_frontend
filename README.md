# Vibeverse Frontend

This repository contains the frontend application for Vibeverse, a cutting-edge music recommendation system developed as part of my final project for a Master's degree in Advanced Computer Science. The app leverages sentiment analysis of song lyrics to offer personalized music suggestions.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the frontend application up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- React Native environment setup

### Installing

Steps to get your development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/alirezaatabaki/vibeverse_frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd vibeverse_frontend
   ```

3. Install the required node modules:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application in development mode:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   Or, if you're using Expo:

   ```
   expo start
   ```

5. Open the application on an emulator or a physical device.

### Backend Integration

This frontend application is designed to work with a Django backend. Ensure that the backend server is running and accessible. For more details on the backend setup, visit the [Vibeverse Backend Repository](https://github.com/alirezaatabaki/vibeverse_backend).

## Usage

The frontend application allows users to explore music recommendations based on the sentiment analysis of lyrics. It includes features such as browsing songs by categories, viewing song details, and playing song previews.
